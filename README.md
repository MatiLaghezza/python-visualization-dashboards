# Python Visualization Dashboards

This repository contains a structured collection of projects, notebooks, and interactive dashboards completed as part of the **IBM Data Visualization with Python** course on Coursera. It showcases my learning journey in data visualization using tools like **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Dash** — with a final dashboard project simulating real-world data storytelling.

> 💡 Goal: Build strong foundational skills and demonstrate practical, hands-on experience in Python-based data visualization.
